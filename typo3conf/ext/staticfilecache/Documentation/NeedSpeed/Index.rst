The need for speed
------------------

Here are some test results for a USER page generated from cache by TYPO3 and one pushed from static html. The test tool used is apache bench. The “-c” means that 10 simultaneous users are simulated, “-n 500” means that a thousand unique requests are generated.

By default apachebench uses NoKeepAlive which means that every image and css file will use a new apache connection.

Future test may include measurements done sucking a complete site (static + dynamic pages) once with static cache enabled and once without static cache enabled. Sucking tools:

- crawler extension (TYPO3)
- curl
- httrack
- wget
- siege
- ... need to check

Tests were run on a Unibody MacBook Pro with 4GB of ram and a tweaked out apache and mysql configuration.

*Test result*

Quick calculation show us a performance increase factor of:
135.24 / 10.23 = 13.22
Let's see that again, but with more energy:
*1322 %*

Wow!

That figure used to read 23000%. But this test was done on a server running on a cluster and not running a PHP accelerator. You may have even more performance increase on a machine running in 'bare metal' mode and running a PHP opcode cache.

Here is an example of my own server running Nginx and APC. It's a lightweight XEN box with 720MB of ram and 4 cores:

That's a slight improvement. But altogether Nginx can take on much more of a beating than Apache. The CPU rises to a load of 0.4 when taking this beating without StaticFileCache and it idles at 0.0 when StaticFileCache is enabled.

Soo ... bring on those success reports!
