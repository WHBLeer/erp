/**
 * This class contains an abstract SSL backend for the TYPO3 RSA authentication
 * service.
 *
 * There are two steps:
 * - prepare data for encoding
 * - decode incoming data
 *
 * To prepare data for encoding, the createNewKeyPair() method should be called.
 * This method returns an instance of \TYPO3\CMS\Rsaauth\Keypair class, which contains
 * the private and public keys. Public key is sent to the client to encode data.
 * Private key should be stored somewhere (preferably in user's session).
 *
 * To decode data, the decrypt() method should be called with the private key
 * created at the previous step and the data to decode. If the data is decoded
 * successfully, the result is a string. Otherwise it is NULL.
