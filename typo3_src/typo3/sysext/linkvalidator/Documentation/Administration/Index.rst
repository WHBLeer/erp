Administration
--------------

Use the extension manager to install linkvalidator. It is not
installed by default.

Apply the needed changes to the database.

You are advised to use cURL to check for links. Linkvalidator uses the
HTTP request library shipped with TYPO3. Please have a look in the
Install Tool at the section "All Configuration" which includes an HTTP
section at the end.

There you may define a default timeout and you may change from using
sockets to using the cURL library.
