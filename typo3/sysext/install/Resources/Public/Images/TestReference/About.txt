These comparison images was generated by Kasper Skårhøj, using:

- TYPO3 3.8.0

- Image Magick 5.5.7 / FreeType 2 / PHP4

- This localconf.php configuration:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['processor_path_lzw'] = '';
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['TTFdpi'] = '96';
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['gdlib_png'] = '1';
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['processor_path'] = '/usr/bin/';
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['processor'] = 'im5';
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['processor_effects'] = true;
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']['gdlib_2'] = 1;

- PHP / GD configuration:
GD Support		enabled
GD Version		2.0 or higher
FreeType Support	enabled
FreeType Linkage	with freetype
T1Lib Support		enabled
GIF Read Support	enabled
GIF Create Support	enabled
JPG Support		enabled
PNG Support		enabled
WBMP Support		enabled

- I was not able to create GIF files for reference so I just converted them directly with ImageMagick

- Also LZW compression has NOT been used anywhere except the GD test images since ImageMagick doesn't support it.
